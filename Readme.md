 -  This tool has created for Android Simulator devices primarily.
  -   However, it can easily be adopted for other Android versions or
   vendors by modifying `device.py`. Mostly, window and activity
   variables need to be changed for other platforms.
   - Documentation and
   usage instructions will be published soon
